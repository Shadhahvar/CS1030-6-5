            <h2>Mobile Suit: The Traveling Gallery</h2>
            <article>
                <p><strong>Mobile Suit: The Traveling Gallery</strong> is the premier nomadic art organization for mecha pop art in the United States.</p><p>Our mission is to bridge the gap between niche mechanical design and mainstream appreciation by transforming local venues into immersive metallic landscapes. While our roots are firmly planted in American soil, our vision is absolute: to become a global conduit for mecha artistry, connecting fans from Tokyo to Berlin.</p>
                <h3>Our Previous Showcases</h3>
                <p>Our recent national tour, "Iron Spirits," saw record-breaking attendance, largely thanks to our expanded focus on diverse mechanical aesthetics. We were honored to showcase rare concept sketches from the <strong>Neon Genesis Evangelion</strong> series, which drew massive crowds in Chicago. In Seattle, our gallery successfully highlighted the gritty, industrial realism found in the <strong>Armored Trooper VOTOMS</strong> and <strong>Fang of the Sun Dougram</strong> franchises, captivating those who appreciate "Real Robot" engineering.</p>
                <p>Beyond the tactical, we’ve also found immense success celebrating the high-concept, stylized designs of <strong>Code Geass</strong> and the roaring "Super Robot" energy of <strong>Gurren Lagann</strong> and <strong>Mazinger Z</strong>. By featuring the legendary work of artists from <strong>The Big O</strong> and the sleek, futuristic lines of <strong>Patlabor</strong>, Mobile Suit continues to prove that the mecha genre is a vast, multifaceted art form capable of inspiring a universal audience.</p>
